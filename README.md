# roman-numerals

## Requirements

Write a function to convert from normal numbers to Roman Numerals: eg
1 --> I
10 --> X
7 --> VII

### Process of thought

1. Initialize an empty string result to store the Roman numeral representation.
2. Enter a while loop that continues until num becomes 0.
3. Inside the loop, various if and else if conditions are used to check the value of num against different Roman numeral symbols.
4. edge case: function should return an empty string when num is 0

### How to run

1. clone this repo
2. run test
